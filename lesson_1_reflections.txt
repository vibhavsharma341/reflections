What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros are gives flexibility to the user and a better environment
    cons are user always have to be attentive to commit at each point of time rather than working on his work tension free 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    to provide a unified picture of the change

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    by using git log and using commit its to do git diff and viewing various changes

could break something?

    to  the very extent, as i can revert to any version to see if there is a bug

    to make changes to bigger projects in a large extent without worry
